# Malaria-Detection-from-Blood-cell
In this project we will predict the presence of plasmodium parasite in the blood cell using the images dataset of the blood cells of parasitized and uninfected persons. The parasitized blood cells means that patient is infected with malaria and uninfected cell means that person is not patient of malaria.
